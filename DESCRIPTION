Description: stcm provides a number of functions for carrying out
    inference with set-theoretic comparative methods, including
    facilities for examining causal paths, assessing the sensitivity
    of results to measurement and model specification error, performing
    Random Forest Comparative Analysis (RFCA) as proposed by 
    Krogslund & Michel (2014), as well as interfacing with other 
    predictive models.
